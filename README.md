# League of Legends Onboarding App

This is an onboarding app with a **League of Legends** theme, built using **Jetpack Compose**. It features smooth screen transitions, a local database with **Room**, asynchronous database calls using **Coroutines**, **MVI architecture** for state management, and **Hilt** for dependency injection.

## Features

- **Smooth Screen Transitions & Animations**: Engaging and interactive user experience with seamless transitions between onboarding screens.
- **Room Database**: Efficient management of local data storage.
- **Coroutines**: Used for performing asynchronous database calls, ensuring smooth performance without UI blocking.
- **MVI Architecture**: Clear and maintainable state management with **states** and **channels** for unique events like Snackbars and screen navigation.
- **Hilt**: Dependency injection for modular, decoupled code with **binds** to facilitate repository abstraction.

## Technologies Used

- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI toolkit for Android development.
- **Room**: Local database for data storage.
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming for handling background tasks.
- **MVI Architecture**: For managing UI states and events.
- **Hilt**: For dependency injection.
- **Kotlin**: The language used for development.

## Work in Progress

The project is still in progress. The following features are yet to be integrated:

- **League of Legends API**: Integration for retrieving in-game data such as characters, abilities, lore, etc.
